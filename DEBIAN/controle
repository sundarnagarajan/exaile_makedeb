Description: Exaile Media Player
  Exaile is a media player which incorporates many of the cool things from
  Amarok (and other media players) like automatic fetching of album art,
  handling of large libraries, lyrics fetching, artist/album information via
  Wikipedia, last.fm support, and optional iPod support (assuming you have
  python-gpod installed).
 .
  In addition, Exaile also includes tabbed playlists (so you can have more
  than one playlist open at a time), blacklisting of tracks (so they don't
  get scanned into your library), downloading of guitar tablature from
  fretplay.com, and submitting played tracks on your iPod to last.fm.
  .
  Exaile aims to be similar to AmaroK, but uses Python and GTK+.
